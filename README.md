Smart Home System Simulation

Overview

This project simulates a Smart Home System where users can control various smart devices like lights, thermostats, and door locks through a central hub. Users can set schedules, automate tasks, and monitor the status of each device.

Functional Requirements

Initialization: The system should be initialized with different devices, each identified by a unique ID and type (e.g., light, thermostat, door lock).

Device Control:

Turn devices on and off.

Schedule devices to turn on or off at specific times.

Automate tasks based on triggers

Dynamic Device Management: The system should allow for adding or removing devices dynamically.

Design Patterns

Behavioral Pattern: The Observer Pattern is used to update all devices when a change occurs in the system.

Creational Pattern: The Factory Method is employed for creating instances of different smart devices.

Structural Pattern: The Proxy Pattern is utilized to control access to the devices.

Key Concepts

Encapsulation: Ensuring that each class hides its internal state and only exposes necessary functionalities.

Modularity: Designing the system in a way that each component is independent and can be modified without affecting others.

Inheritance and Polymorphism: Leveraging these OOP principles to create a flexible and scalable system architecture.

How to Run

	Clone the repository.

	Use the provided interface to control devices, set schedules, and automate tasks.
